Create a process, named MultiHead, 
having three threads, named Ittu, Bittu, and Mittu .
Ittu, Bittu, and Mittu  perform addition, subtraction 
and multiplication of two variables sent by the main thread
of the process and keep the output in a global variable, 
result. All threads print their process ID, thread ID,
CPU Info and the global variable, 'result'.

The main thread waits until each thread finish its task.
The main thread reads and sends two integer values 
to each thread 100 times.

If any thread finds that 'result' = 100, 
it immediately send signal to the main thread to stop 
the process.

Take necessary steps to avoid thread racing.
