Create a process, named Laltu, having three processes,
 named Ittu, Bittu, and Mittu .

Laltu reads two variables 'a' and 'b' which 
all its child process know somehow.

Ittu, Bittu, and Mittu  perform addition, subtraction and 
multiplication of
two variables read by Laltu and keep the output 
in a variable, 'Result'.

Result will be seen and accessed by all processes.
That means all processes will see the updated value of
'Result.

All processes print their process ID, CPU Info, 
and values of 'a' and 'b' before performing their 
corresponding operation

 using separate printf instruction. 
 Then they perform their operations which they are 
 supposed to be done. 

 Then each process will print 'Result'.
Laltu will waits until Ittu, Bittu and Mittu finish 
their tasks.

Take necessary steps to avoid inconsistency in 'Result'.
