Create a process named, Galaxy, having two child processes, named Nebula and BlackHole.
Nebula and BlackHole are in 100 times loop.
Main threads of all processes are in 10 times loop.
Galaxy waits for Nebula and Blackhole to be finished.
Both Nebula and BlackHole have  two threads, named X and Y.
All threads of Galaxy, Nebula and BlackHole show their PID, logical CPU info,
CPU_Affinity and scheduling algorithm's information.
Check whether any threads and any processes change their logical processors during their execution.
Force Blackhole's all threads run in different logical processors whenever they are in the running state.
Force Nebula to use a scheduling algorithm other than default scheduling algorithm.
